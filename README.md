For classifying the images I used a rule-based approach where color-based segmentation is applied to identify areas of green(lush), brown(growing), and white(no_crop) in the images.After annotating the images with their respective labels, they are split into training and testing sets, which are used to train and evaluate the CNN model, respectively.

The CNN model utilizes convolutional and max-pooling layers for feature extraction and dimensionality reduction, followed by fully connected layers for classification with ReLU activation functions. This approach combines rule-based image classification with deep learning techniques, trained with the Adam optimizer and evaluated using accuracy metrics and a confusion matrix to assess performance.
